Hello, I'm Nancy and currently live in Jinan. I'm an Internet practitioner.

With a nervous and complicated mood, I built my first blog on Github.

Here, it will be a record of my daily life and also a place to share the problems I encounter at work.

I hope that in this small world, we can communicate with each other and give advice to one another.
